# HorribleGLEngine
An attempt to clone CS1.6 in with WebGL :/ 

### About
No, I'm not literally drawing out every vertex with glStart(GL_TRIANGLES); ... glEnd(); but I'm absolutely amazed at [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJYfCcenyjHr3DZ9JWHbkQ)
and I've been watching him create a Game Engine from scratch just baffled lol. He's quite gifted in algorithm development, but I think the lack of a basic 
precalculus background ... not knowing how to calculate the Field of View of a pinhole camera, for example:

leads him to make a lot of weird decisions (_I stuff think he's a genius btw and he's done more than I would ever be able too_). Secondly, I don't see OpenGL full screen windows being a thing for much longer. Full screen experiences are fun, but I have a theory that we're going to start seeing more weird places to embed 3D environments, :man_shrugging:
