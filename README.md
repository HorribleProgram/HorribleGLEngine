# HorribleGLEngine
An attempt to clone CS1.6 in with WebGL :/ 

### About
No, I'm not literally drawing out every vertex with glStart(GL_TRIANGLES); ... glEnd(); but I'm absolutely amazed at [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJYfCcenyjHr3DZ9JWHbkQ)
and I've been watching him create a Game Engine from scratch just baffled lol. He's quite gifted in algorithm development, but I think the lack of a basic 
precalculus background ... not knowing how to calculate the Field of View of a pinhole camera,
